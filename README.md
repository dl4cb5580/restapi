# restapi

1. I have implemented the myRetail RESTful service.
2. I have used Java 8, JAX-RS, Jersey 1.8, Eclipse 4.7, Apache Tomcat 8.5 and Maven 3.5 for the development, deployment and testing.
3. I have provided some simple JUnit test cases.
4. I have also added a class to test the application using Jersey client considering that the application/REST API is deployed and accesible on localhost:8080.
5. I have used a HashMap for storing the Product Price information. For production, we should use any industry stabdard Key-Value NoSQL data store like Dynamo or Cassandra.
6. I have created the swagger file for REST API documentation also.
